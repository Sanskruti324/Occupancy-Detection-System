# Occupancy-Detection-System
In a large building (corporate building) the complete room e.g. conference hall may not be filled completely and only those devices/appliances need to work where people are present, not of the entire room 2. For the detection of room occupancy we can use cameras having an algorithm (image processing) to detect human beings inside the room 3. The entire room can be divided into different sections. So when the camera detects a person(s) inside that particular section it will send a signal to a controller which will activate appliance of that section and not of the whole room. 4>Normal camera can be used by using a a camera for each section of the room. Further 3-D cameras can be used to get particular coordinate of the person(s) to increase efficiency of the system 5>Precise image processing algorithm can detect as well as track motion to increase energy efficiency which is not possible via sensor.
